# New Project (MCP-enabled)

## Setup

1. Create a new repo from this template on GitHub.  
2. Open Cursor → **clone the repo** into your workspace.  
3. In Cursor, start chat with:  MCP Setup & Usage (Reusable)

(the Project Instruction prompt)  

That’s it — Cursor will read `.env` + `.context/claude.md`, set up MCP servers, and you’re ready to build.
